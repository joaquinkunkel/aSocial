# aSocial
aSocial utilizes an interface and language akin to those found in social media platforms. Its users can write, comment, react to, and share posts, change their profile picture, and even keep a friend list. What makes aSocial inherently different from social networks is the fact that each post, each picture, and each friend list is only available to its author.

The purpose of aSocial is not to connect people (hence its name). On the contrary, it aims to create an environment in which a person can build an image of themself without having to think about having an external audience. This provides an introspective, personal experience aimed to work in duality with the sources of social interaction that already exist online.

The features in the user interface of aSocial are aligned to this principle:

The Share (send) button on a post gives the user the option to share it with their past or future self. If the user selects their future self, they can specify a date in which they will receive said post in a notification.

The friend list does not link to any other profiles in aSocial. Instead, it is a list of names that the user can edit according to how their social relations change.

Instead of "likes" or "favorites," the reaction (mood) button on a post gives the user a list of options to evaluate his or her own personality in relation to the post. Rather than "love" or "funny", the user is presented with options such as "kind" or "evil", "lazy" or "diligent", and so on, to react to posts.

Social networks give millions of people incredible opportunities to communicate and connect in amazing ways. The intention of aSocial is to stand side-by-side with social media and to pose interesting prompts to reflect on the concept of social media. aSocial is not meant to be a completely logical, practical application. I instead characterize it as speculative design.
